# Prompt:
You are an experienced AI engineer and software architect.  
I am a Data Product Owner and Technical Lead, starting a new project: **Personal Health & Fitness Dashboard**.  

**Project Description:**  
The goal is to build a web-based dashboard for tracking and analyzing health data from multiple sources (Apple Watch, nutrition apps, and manual entries).  

**Problem Statement:**  
Currently, health device data, exercise logs, weight measurements, and nutrition data are not centralized or visualized in one place. This makes it difficult for users to track trends and correlations. A centralized dashboard will allow users to see a holistic view of their health in one place.  

**Your Tasks:**  
1. **Technology Stack Recommendation**  
   - Propose a suitable tech stack for a Proof of Concept (PoC).  
   - I was considering **Python + Streamlit**, with possible HTML components for better visualization.  
   - Please analyze the pros/cons and suggest alternatives that would scale better in the long run.  

2. **Data Structure Design**  
   - Propose a data schema for storing and processing the health data.  As for the PoC phase I will use data entry to popualte the data and I will store it on CSV/excel for the PoC.
   - The data will mainly be **daily time series**.  
   - For simplicity, assume all metrics are expressed on a per-day basis (e.g., sleep duration, calories burned, calories consumed, number of steps, etc.).  
   - Suggest how to structure this data for both short-term PoC and long-term scalability.  

**Output Format:**  
- Provide clear recommendations for the tech stack, with reasoning.  
- Provide a proposed data schema (tables, fields, or JSON structure).
